Git Assignment - maraqa-chu92
a. Issues can be tasks, features or bugs that developers can track as a team
b. A pull request is how we signal changes we make, that we want to eventually incorporate into the codebase after they're reviewed
c. You should fork and clone the repository you want to make changes to, create a branch, input your changes, then commit, push and 
create the pull request. Then, you can review and adress feedback, and finally merge the pull request if the review is successful
d. From your repository settings,go to Collaborators settings and invite the person by entering their contact info (name, GitHub 
username, or email). Then, choose the access level (Read, Write, or Admin) and send the invitation.
e. Git is a version control system used for managing codebases locally, while GitHub is an online platform that lets you host Git 
repositories “on the cloud”.
f. `git diff` shows the differences between changes in the working directory and the staging area.
g. The "main" branch is the primary development branch where the latest stable version of a  project is found.
h. Best practice is to avoid pushing changes directly to the main branch, and instead create a new branch for each feature or bug 
fix, then merge those changes into the main branch through a pull request after they've been reviewed and approved.
